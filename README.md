# Apex-Legends-Anti-Recoil
I forked the [repl] (https://github.com/GoogleBhrome/Apex-Legends-Anti-Recoil) and made some minor change, it is more easy to use now.

If you're new to python, just google some video tutorials on youtube to learn how to correctly install python and modules.

### Requirements
python3

And you will need to PIP these modules
import pyautogui
import time
import win32api
import random
import keyboard

### Quickstart

I assume you've already installed python, click [here](https://github.com/Xeift/Apex-Legends-Anti-Recoil/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) to download file you need.

After that, unzip the folder and you'll see `apex_recoil_adjust.py`. Right click and open/run it with idle or vs code.

`Caps lock` Active/Deactive the script

`F1~F12` Adjust recoil offset. The higher the numer is, the more recoil will be offset. The best recoil for R99 is 7. You can try them by yourselves.
